# offense-b-gone

Offense-b-gone is is an Ad Block Plus list that seeks to block only sexually suggestive and similar offensive ad-types, while not 
blocking other advertisements.

*To get started:*
 - Install ABP (Ad block plus) as a plugin for just about any browser: https://adblockplus.org/
 - Navigate to ABP settings
 - Add a custom list: [http://ryancastro.com/offense-b-gone/offensebgone.txt](http://ryancastro.com/offense-b-gone/offensebgone.txt)
 - If you're a good netizen who wants to block _only_ offensive ads, disable the other default lists.

No more inappropriate cheerleader photos and bikini babes! That's the goal.

Please feel free to contribute to this project in the form of pull requests.
